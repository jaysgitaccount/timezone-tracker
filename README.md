# timezone-tracker
My first React project! I used `create-react-app` to set it up.

What I intend for this project is to create a convenient way for people who aren't thinking that hard about timezone differences to be able to track the difference in time between locations. This includes whether a location is experience DST or not. I've always had problems understanding the time in America or Europe vs my current location, so I'm hoping to clear up some confusion for myself, and also learn React while I'm at it!

My goals for this project:
- Familiarize myself with ReactJS
- Learn how to build a working analog clock interface for web
- Practice clean and modular code, using composition
- Maybe learn a bit more about how timezones work
